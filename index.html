<h3> Data Backup</h3>
<img src="data backup.jpeg" hspace="376px">
<p>
	The purpose of the backup is to create a copy of data that can be recovered in the event of a primary data failure. Primary data failures can be the result of hardware or software failure, data corruption, or a human-caused event, such as a malicious attack (virus or malware), or accidental deletion of data. Backup copies allow data to be restored from an earlier point in time to help the business recover from an unplanned event. We shoud backup our data for the following reasons:
	<ul>
		<li>
			 Data Loss Prevention<br>
We’ve all heard about or experienced a tragic loss of data. The main reason for data backup is to save important files if a system crash or hard drive failure occurs.
		</li>
<li>
Operation Plan B <br>
There should be additional data backups if the original backups result in data corruption or hard drive failure. This option is best done via the cloud or offsite storage. Additional backups are necessary if natural or man-made disasters occur. Storms and warfare can lead to the destruction of servers and computers due to fires and floods. Luckily, we are in the age of cloud technology, where backup your data has become easier and more secure than ever before.
</li>
<li>
Saving Time<br>
If you have a data loss, you will have to work to fix it. This might be as annoying as having to rewrite an important email because your computer crashed right before you hit sent, or as serious as rebuilding your entire client database. While you or your employees are working on data recovery, you are not working on the core of your business. Some companies might have to redo everything. Literally everything – and few businesses survive that.
</li>
<li>
Data loss can occur at any time and for all kinds of reasons<br>
This might include crashes, malware, physical damage or failure, theft, or basic user error. If you claim you have never deleted a vital file by mistake then you are probably lying or seldom use a computer (there is a reason deleted files go to a trash folder before vanishing completely). Laptops make you particularly vulnerable – they can be damaged or stolen, especially while traveling. Incremental backups allow you to restore either specific files or your entire system easily.
</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	Tips on how to backup data
	<ul>
		<li>
			Regularly backup your data at leats once a month 
		</li>
		<li>
			Save it online (on cloud)
		</li>	
		<li>
			Save it on external harddisk for safety reasons
		</li>
		<li>
			Ensure tht data usage is working properly and to ensure tha=e proper working of back up restore it often.
		</li>
	</ul>

</p>
<h3>

</h3>
<p>
	It is important to maintain a good digital footprint because if anyone look you up on the internet your digital footpprint will be accesible to them. Here are a few things that might be helpful in making a good digital footprint
	<ul>
